These days, I start learning machine learning, and I use tensorflow to learn machine learning
And I met some hard problem in installing tensorflow;

/*My device info*/
/*Operating system: windows 10*/
/tensorflow version: cpu version*/

//Here is my problem

question:Error:Cannot uninstall 'werkzeug'..
solution:pip install werkzeug --ignore-installed

I find one interesting thing when I meet these problems,you can use these code to solve most of these problems.

pip install module --ignore-installed
